# Foodie-Fi

This is another sql project created by Danny Ma to help develop your SQL skills and exercise your logical problem solving skills whilst exposing you to various functions and questions encountered in the industry.

I have chosen to do it in Python because it highlights how you can create a database on your system to allow for continuous use.

Before getting started, I would recommend installing "ipython-sql". This allows you use the 'jupyter magic' function to interact with your relational database.
